### About
Finding out details about public places to work can be tedious. WhereToCode enables you to get the information you need, and only that information, to work and code on the go.

### Features
 - Clear information on each location for people to determine if it will work
 - New spaces are easy to make
 - Locations with most use/activity/rating show up first

## Getting Started
### NPM Scripts

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **npm install** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run server** to start the local server
- **npm test** to start server using testing environment
- **npm run watch** to start the test in watch mode
- **npm run migrate** to migrate the tables
- **npm run seed** to seed the tables
- **npm run rollback** to rollback all tables
- **npm run reset-db** to rollback, migrate and seed the tables at a go

## Technologies

[NodeJS]() -  is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

The [**Express.js**](https://expressjs.com/ ) backend framework was used to build the server. Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js

#### Why Express.js

- Express is fast.
- Express is efficient.
- Express is scalable.
- Express is a lightweight framework.

## Supporting Packages
Linter
 - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - The pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX

Test Tools
